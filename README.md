# Deep segmentation of brain perivascular spaces in T1-weighted MRI of Parkinson’s disease via soft supervision and morphological refinement 

### Data & Code Availability

After -and in case of- paper acceptance, this repository will host the anonymized, skull-stripped imaging data and source code of our newly-developed 3D deep learning framework for multi-output segmentation of PVS in low-field T1-weighted MRI of patients clinically diagnosed with PD:
